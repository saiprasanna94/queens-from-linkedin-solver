# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Run/Test Commands
- Run: `python queens-screenshot.py`
- Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn pillow pyautogui matplotlib scipy`
- No formal testing framework

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Python 3.x syntax
- Follow PEP 8 conventions (4 spaces indentation)
- Organize code into classes with clear responsibilities
- Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep line length under 100 characters
- Use typing annotations when possible
- Use numpy arrays for efficient image operations
- Handle exceptions with specific try/except blocks
- Prefer descriptive variable names over abbreviations
- Import order: standard library, third-party, local
- Include debug information and visualizations where helpful
